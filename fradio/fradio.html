        <h4>Details:</h4>
          <p class="description">
            Fradio was a mobile app that allowed you to run something similar to a radio station from your phone. You could select the music, record yourself speaking over it, take "calls" from listeners, chat with them, and all of this happened live.</br> 
            This was a very fun and challenging project to work on and I had a mainly Junior Developer role. The app had to not only consume a live stream of audio but also upload audio recordings live. The real time chat was also an interesting challenge as it was a very different engineering problem to anything I had worked on before.</br> 
            The project was written in Java with an MVP architecture, and made use of RxJava.
