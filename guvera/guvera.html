        <h4>Details:</h4>
          <p class="description">
            Guvera was a music streaming app with over 10 million downloads (on android alone). </br>
            I worked on it as a tester for about a year and then as an android developer for about two years. The app was written in Java and had an MVC architecture which was common at the time the project was started. </br>
            I had a hand in creating some of the features that would then go on to be used by millions of users, including some of the social features.
